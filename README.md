# Beggars

My first ranked storyboard made for NeilPerry: https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/881753#osu/1843575

It didn't start with Neil asking me, basically, Tochi- wanted to do the storyboard. But went overboard when doing a 20mb animated loop that took too much space for the osz. So a complete redo is what I needed to do. 

## Files
**Fonts**: Of course there are multiple fonts used, Ostrich Sans for the Kiai and V-GERB (bold) for the rest. 

**scriptslibrary**: a storybrew function that I forgot to use.

**conflux.json | insane.json**: Both of these json files determine the placements of collab text that is shown on the storyboard. It's a way to make things more modular and easier to port to other storyboards.

**lyrics.json**: Same thing as above, but with position movements and fonts for the lyrics.

**Krewella X DISKORD - Beggars (Consouls Remix) (NeilPerry).osb**: Tochi's original osb that had animations galore.

**Main.cs**: Basically, every function and scene of the storyboard is in this file. It's uncommented right now, but I can do that later on.

**Newtonsoft.Json.dll**: Of course, every json file in C# requires Newtonsoft..

**Parallax.cs | Particles.cs**: These two files are what I used as inspiration to place into the storyboard, Parallax was taken from Fatfan Kolek's Megalovania Dual Mix by Bergy. and Particles is the default from storybrew.
